This project uses real data collected by the makers of the FireFox web browser in order to examine whether tab support or bookmark support for browsers should be revamped. It analyzes the result of SQL queries in order to shed light upon and solve this specific business problem. The data includes demographic metrics from a wide variety of web browser users, as well as metrics with respect to the individual browsers themselves.
